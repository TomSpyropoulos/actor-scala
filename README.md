# IoT Data Pipeline (Scala & Pekko)

A high-performance, containerized IoT data pipeline implemented using **Scala**, **Pekko Actors**, and **Pekko Streams**. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable messaging system that handles real-time sensor data with backpressure and efficient resource management.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1.  **[Service Publisher](service-publisher/)**: A Scala application that simulates IoT sensors. Each instance generates 1000 sensor readings (JSON) per second and publishes them to an MQTT broker.
2.  **Mosquitto MQTT Broker**: Acts as the central messaging hub, facilitating communication between publishers and subscribers.
3.  **[Service Subscriber](service-subscriber/)**: A Scala application that consumes messages from the `sensors/#` wildcard topic. It dynamically creates a dedicated Pekko Actor for each unique sensor topic to maintain state (running sum and last timestamp). DB writes are handled through a pluggable `DatabaseBackend` trait, with the active implementation selected at runtime via `DB_BACKEND`.
4.  **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from the containers, the host system, and the **Service Subscriber**.
5.  **Grafana**: Provides a visual dashboard for monitoring container resource usage and application-specific metrics.
6.  **TimescaleDB**: A PostgreSQL extension for high-performance time-series data storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running the Pipeline

To start the entire stack with 3 simulated sensors (publisher instances):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --scale publisher=3
```

### Monitoring & Logs

- **Grafana**: Accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) without authentication.
    - Pre-provisioned with Prometheus and a "Container Monitoring" dashboard.
- **Prometheus UI**: Accessible at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
- **Subscriber Metrics**: Raw endpoint available at [http://localhost:8081/metrics](http://localhost:8081/metrics).
    - `subscriber_requests_total` — throughput counter.
    - `subscriber_request_latency_milliseconds` — publisher→subscriber latency, histogram.
    - `subscriber_e2e_latency_milliseconds` — publisher→DB latency, histogram.
    - `subscriber_db_write_latency_milliseconds` — subscriber→DB write latency, histogram.
    - All three share one bucket list with the other repo, so quantiles are comparable across arms
      by construction; `histogram_quantile()` computes them at query time over any window.
    - `subscriber_sensor_up{device="<name>"}` — per-sensor liveness gauge (1 = ALIVE, 0 = MISSING).
- **Subscriber Logs**:
    ```bash
    docker logs -f subscriber
    ```

## 🔬 Benchmarking

The subscriber's DB write path is decoupled from any specific database through a pluggable `DatabaseBackend` trait. The active backend is selected at startup via the `DB_BACKEND` environment variable, with no recompilation required.

### How `bench.sh` works

`bench.sh` takes a scenario file, sources it as environment variables, starts the full Docker Compose stack with the configured number of publisher instances (`PUBLISHER_COUNT`), and waits until the stack is actually ingesting — first for the subscriber's Prometheus endpoint to answer, then for `subscriber_requests_total` to start advancing. The second check matters because the metrics server binds before the subscriber has necessarily reached the broker or the database, so a subscriber that died during startup still serves a scrapeable `/metrics` with every counter at zero. A rep that does not begin ingesting within `INGEST_TIMEOUT` seconds (default `60`) is **skipped**: its container logs are dumped, no JSON is written, and the sweep moves on, so a dead run can never be averaged into a report cell. `bench.sh all` reports the number of skipped reps in its closing summary. It then sets up a Python virtual environment under `benchmarking/.venv` (installing `benchmarking/requirements.txt` automatically on first run — no manual setup needed) and hands off to `benchmarking/monitor.py`.

`monitor.py` queries Prometheus directly for the same panels shown on the "Container Monitoring" Grafana dashboard (ingest rate, committed-rows rate, the three latency histograms, sensor liveness, container CPU/memory) every `METRICS_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 10) and renders them as a live-updating view: a throughput/resource table plus a latency matrix (stage × quantile, with an exact mean beside them). It also collects the raw cumulative histogram buckets, which have no dashboard panel and exist purely so a run can be re-sliced offline. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop: it prints an avg/max summary and saves every raw, timestamped sample to a JSON file under `benchmarking/output/`.

Aggregates cover **steady state only** — the first `WARMUP_SECONDS` (default `30`) are excluded, since throughput ramps from ~11k to 20k msg/s over the first ten seconds while publishers connect against a cold DB, and averaging that in understates throughput and inflates every latency figure. `RUN_DURATION` defaults to `90` in a sweep so a full minute of steady state remains after the trim and the 15s rate window. Every sample is still stored whole, so the trim is a reporting parameter: a run can be re-sliced at a different boundary without re-collecting it. `bench.sh` then runs a clean `docker compose down -v`.

  db  (sub->db)    26.8    43.2    52.4    76.1
```

`msgs/s` counts messages **ingested** off MQTT, while `committed/s` counts rows **actually written to the database**. They track each other while the DB keeps up; a sustained gap between them is the clearest signal that the write path — not the pipeline — is the bottleneck.

**Single vs. batch mode.** `bench.sh <scenario>` runs one scenario interactively (stop with `Ctrl+C`). Set `RUN_DURATION` to run it unattended for a fixed number of seconds instead. `bench.sh all` sweeps **every** scenario in `benchmarking/scenarios/` back-to-back: it builds the images once up front, runs each for `RUN_DURATION` seconds (default `90`), writes one JSON per rep to `benchmarking/output/`, and tears the stack down (`docker compose down -v`) between reps so each starts cold.

**Repetitions.** Each scenario is run `REPS` times (default `1`, but `3` in `bench.sh all`), tearing the stack down between reps so run-to-run noise can be told apart from a real runtime difference. Each rep's JSON is tagged `..._repN_...json`. Set `REPS` on a single scenario too (with `RUN_DURATION`) to repeat it unattended.

**Post-run report.** After a full `bench.sh all` sweep, `benchmarking/report.py` aggregates every per-rep JSON into [`benchmarking/output/report.csv`](benchmarking/output/report.csv) (one row per scenario) and [`benchmarking/output/report.md`](benchmarking/output/report.md). The Markdown report has three parts: one **headline** table per OFAT group, a **startup** table, and a **provenance** block recording the trim, run duration, bucket-list fingerprint and rep counts needed to reproduce or re-slice the figures.

Headline tables report `msgs_s` (ingested) alongside `committed_s` (committed to the DB), and p50/p95/p99/p999 plus an exact mean for each of the three latencies — all over steady state only. Throughput and resource cells are `mean ± stdev` across reps. Latency cells are a **pooled quantile**: the reps' steady-state histogram buckets are summed and one quantile taken over the total, with the per-rep min–max shown where the reps disagreed by more than 5%. Averaging per-rep quantiles instead can report a value no rep ever observed — three reps whose p99s are 10 ms, 10 ms and 300 ms average to 107 ms, while the p99 of the same 3000 observations is 300 ms. The per-rep spread is what shows when the reps were not interchangeable.

The startup table carries one row per scenario: how long the stack took to serve metrics and then to ingest its first message, the measured time-to-steady-state, and the warm-up p99 — turning the startup transient from a contaminant into the JVM-ramp-vs-BEAM-flat-start comparison it should be. Time-to-steady-state is reported, never used to trim: a per-rep trim would give the two arms windows of different length and phase. `bench.sh all` first clears `benchmarking/output/*.json` so the report covers only that sweep; run a single scenario and invoke `report.py` yourself if you'd rather accumulate runs across sweeps. Run it standalone at any time against an existing `output/` directory:

```bash
benchmarking/.venv/bin/python benchmarking/report.py
```

To override the poll interval, set `METRICS_INTERVAL` in your scenario file or environment (defaults: `5`s in duration mode, `10`s interactive).

### Running a scenario

```bash
chmod +x bench.sh

# One scenario, interactively (Ctrl+C to stop):
./bench.sh benchmarking/scenarios/timescale_load_p20.env

# One scenario, fixed 60s unattended run:
RUN_DURATION=90 ./bench.sh benchmarking/scenarios/timescale_load_p20.env

# The full OFAT sweep (all 25 scenarios, 90s each, unattended):
./bench.sh all
```

### Available scenarios

All 25 scenarios follow a **one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT)** design: every file changes exactly one variable from a shared **anchor** (`20` publishers ≈ 20k msg/s, pool `20`, batching on at size `50` / timeout `200`ms, no payload padding), so any measured effect is attributable to that one factor.

The anchor batches because the single-row write path cannot sustain 20k msg/s: rows queue ahead of the database and end-to-end latency climbs for as long as the run lasts, which makes the measured percentiles a function of `RUN_DURATION` rather than of the runtime under test. The `Batching` group keeps one `BATCH_ENABLED=false` run as the reference point showing that.

Since there is now a single anchor, six files are identical to it (`load_p20`, `pool_20`, `payload_0`, `batchsize_050`, `batchto_0200`, `batching_on`). That redundancy is deliberate: at `REPS=3` a sweep measures the anchor 18 times, and the spread across those runs is the noise floor that differences elsewhere in the report should be judged against.

| Group | File pattern | Factor swept | Values (**bold** = anchor) |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Load | `timescale_load_p{NN}.env` | `PUBLISHER_COUNT` | 4, 8, 16, **20**, 32, 48 |
| Pool | `timescale_pool_{NN}.env` | `DB_POOL_SIZE` | 5, 10, **20**, 50 |
| Payload | `timescale_payload_{N}.env` | `PAYLOAD_PADDING_BYTES` | **0**, 256, 1KB, 10KB |
| Batch size | `timescale_batchsize_{NNN}.env` | `BATCH_SIZE` | 20, **50**, 100, 200, 500 |
| Batch timeout | `timescale_batchto_{NNNN}.env` | `BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 50, **200**, 500, 1000 |
| Batching | `timescale_batching_{off,on}.env` | `BATCH_ENABLED` | off, **on** |

The two batch factors are not independent: a buffer flushes on whichever trigger fires first, so the
**effective batch size** is roughly `min(BATCH_SIZE, per-writer rate × BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS)`. Rows are routed
round-robin across `DB_POOL_SIZE` writers, so at the anchor each writer sees ≈ 19k/20 ≈ 950 rows/s and a
50-row buffer fills in ≈ 53ms — well under the 200ms timeout, which makes `BATCH_SIZE` the binding trigger
under load and leaves the timeout as the latency guard for low-rate periods. Sweeping the timeout below the
fill time therefore does not measure the timeout so much as silently shrink the effective batch. Where the
timeout is the shorter of the two (e.g. `batchto_0050` against the anchor's ≈53ms fill) the timer wins every
cycle rather than racing the buffer, because it is armed on the first row of each new buffer instead of
free-running — so the flush period is fixed and the resulting tail is *tighter* than a size-triggered one,
not noisier.

**Why the load sweep stops at 48 publishers.** Load generation is co-located with the system under
test on the same host, and the publishers are the largest CPU consumer in the stack. Up to 32 publishers
both runtimes deliver ≥97% of the nominal 1000 msg/s per publisher; at 48 Erlang still delivers 98% while
Scala drops to 77%, because a Scala publisher costs roughly 34% more CPU per message. A 64-publisher
scenario used to exist and was removed: at that scale the observability stack fails before any valid
measurement is taken — the Erlang subscriber's `/metrics` endpoint takes 9–16s to answer (against
Prometheus's 2s budget, so its target reports `down` for the whole run) and Scala's cAdvisor target times
out scraping 71 containers. The pipeline itself stays healthy there — the Erlang stack was measured
committing 28k rows/s while Prometheus reported it down — so the failure is one of measurement, not of the
runtimes. Treat 32 publishers as the ceiling for cross-runtime comparison and 48 as an
Erlang-only headroom point.

The no-batch-vs-batch comparison is the `Batching` group: `timescale_batching_off.env` versus
`timescale_batching_on.env` (the latter identical to the anchor).

### Scenario variables reference

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUBLISHER_COUNT` | `1` | Number of publisher containers (`--scale publisher=N`) |
| `DB_BACKEND` | `timescaledb` | Backend implementation to use |
| `DB_POOL_SIZE` | `20` | Total PostgreSQL connections: HikariCP pool size in non-batch mode, `DbWriterActor` count in batch mode. Status writes share these connections rather than a pool of their own, so the count matches the Erlang arm at every value |
| `BATCH_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable row buffering |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | Flush when buffer reaches this many rows |
| `BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1000` | Flush after this many ms even if buffer is not full |
| `PAYLOAD_PADDING_BYTES` | `0` | Extra filler bytes added as a trailing `"padding"` field on top of the shared base payload (identical in both arms), for payload-size benchmarks |
| `RUN_DURATION` | _(unset)_ | Fixed measurement window in seconds. Set it (or use `bench.sh all`, which defaults it to `90`) for an unattended run; leave unset for an interactive `Ctrl+C` run |
| `WARMUP_SECONDS` | `30` | Startup transient excluded from every reported figure. Must be at least the 15s rate window, or the first samples kept are still contaminated by the ramp |
| `STARTUP_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds a rep may take to bring up a scrapeable metrics endpoint before it is skipped |
| `INGEST_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Seconds a rep may take to start ingesting, once its endpoint answers, before it is skipped |
| `REPS` | `1` | Times each scenario is repeated, with a full teardown between reps (`bench.sh all` defaults it to `3`). The report collapses reps to mean ± stdev, and pools their histogram buckets for latency |
| `METRICS_INTERVAL` | `5` / `10` | Seconds between metric snapshots (defaults to `5` in duration mode, `10` interactive) |

### Supported `DB_BACKEND` values

| Value | Class | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `timescaledb` (default) | `TimescaleDBBackend` | PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB via HikariCP + JDBC |

## 🧠 Deep Dive: Pekko Executors

### Fork-Join vs. Virtual Threads

The project explores different execution models for Pekko Actors:

#### Fork-Join Executor (Default)
In the default implementation, actors are dispatched on a `fork-join-executor`. Actors are treated as tasks pushed onto a deque and executed on a fixed pool of platform threads.
- **Pros**: Highly efficient for non-blocking workloads.
- **Cons**: If an actor performs a blocking I/O operation, it stalls the underlying platform thread, potentially leading to thread starvation.

#### Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
Pekko 1.2.0+ and Java 21/24 introduce support for `virtual-thread-executor`. Virtual threads are lightweight, runtime-managed threads (similar to Goroutines in Go).
- **Behavior**: When a virtual thread blocks, it is unpinned from its carrier platform thread, allowing other virtual threads to continue execution.
- **Advantage**: Allows writing simple, blocking code while maintaining the scalability of asynchronous systems.

The current implementation uses the **Fork-Join Executor**. To experiment with Virtual Threads, the `application.conf` can be adjusted to use the `pekko.dispatch.VirtualThreadExecutorConfigurator`.
