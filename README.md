# IoT Data Pipeline (Scala & Pekko)

A high-performance, containerized IoT data pipeline implemented using **Scala**, **Pekko Actors**, and **Pekko Streams**. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable messaging system that handles real-time sensor data with backpressure and efficient resource management.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1.  **[Service Publisher](service-publisher/)**: A Scala application that simulates IoT sensors. Each instance generates 1000 sensor readings (JSON) per second and publishes them to an MQTT broker.
2.  **Mosquitto MQTT Broker**: Acts as the central messaging hub, facilitating communication between publishers and subscribers.
3.  **[Service Subscriber](service-subscriber/)**: A Scala application that consumes messages from the `sensors/#` wildcard topic. It dynamically creates a dedicated Pekko Actor for each unique sensor topic to maintain state (running sum and last timestamp). DB writes are handled through a pluggable `DatabaseBackend` trait, with the active implementation selected at runtime via `DB_BACKEND`.
4.  **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from the containers, the host system, and the **Service Subscriber**.
5.  **Grafana**: Provides a visual dashboard for monitoring container resource usage and application-specific metrics.
6.  **TimescaleDB**: A PostgreSQL extension for high-performance time-series data storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running the Pipeline

To start the entire stack with 3 simulated sensors (publisher instances):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --scale publisher=3
```

### Monitoring & Logs

- **Grafana**: Accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) without authentication.
    - Pre-provisioned with Prometheus and a "Container Monitoring" dashboard.
- **Prometheus UI**: Accessible at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
- **Subscriber Metrics**: Raw endpoint available at [http://localhost:8081/metrics](http://localhost:8081/metrics).
    - `subscriber_requests_total` — throughput counter.
    - `subscriber_request_latency_milliseconds` — publisher→subscriber latency (p50/p95/p99/p999).
    - `subscriber_e2e_latency_milliseconds` — publisher→DB latency (p50/p95/p99/p999).
    - `subscriber_db_write_latency_milliseconds` — subscriber→DB write latency (p50/p95/p99/p999).
    - `subscriber_sensor_up{device="<name>"}` — per-sensor liveness gauge (1 = ALIVE, 0 = MISSING).
- **Subscriber Logs**:
    ```bash
    docker logs -f subscriber
    ```

## 🔬 Benchmarking

The subscriber's DB write path is decoupled from any specific database through a pluggable `DatabaseBackend` trait. The active backend is selected at startup via the `DB_BACKEND` environment variable, with no recompilation required.

### How `bench.sh` works

`bench.sh` takes a scenario file, sources it as environment variables, starts the full Docker Compose stack with the configured number of publisher instances (`PUBLISHER_COUNT`), and waits for the subscriber's Prometheus endpoint to come up. It then sets up a Python virtual environment under `benchmarking/.venv` (installing `benchmarking/requirements.txt` automatically on first run — no manual setup needed) and hands off to `benchmarking/monitor.py`.

`monitor.py` queries Prometheus directly for the same panels shown on the "Container Monitoring" Grafana dashboard (ingest rate, committed-rows rate, the three latency summaries, sensor liveness, container CPU/memory) every `METRICS_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 10) and renders them as a live-updating view: a throughput/resource table plus a latency matrix (stage × quantile). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop: it prints an avg/max summary of the run and saves every raw, timestamped sample to a JSON file under `benchmarking/output/` — so you can revisit or replot a run's data later without re-running the (slow) benchmark. `bench.sh` then runs a clean `docker compose down -v`.

```

  Publishers  : 5  (~5000 msg/s)

                    Latencies (ms)

  req (pub->sub)   12.3    28.4    40.1    58.2
  e2e (pub->db)    27.9    44.6    53.8    77.5
  db  (sub->db)    26.8    43.2    52.4    76.1
```

`msgs/s` counts messages **ingested** off MQTT, while `committed/s` counts rows **actually written to the database**. They track each other while the DB keeps up; a sustained gap between them is the clearest signal that the write path — not the pipeline — is the bottleneck.

**Single vs. batch mode.** `bench.sh <scenario>` runs one scenario interactively (stop with `Ctrl+C`). Set `RUN_DURATION` to run it unattended for a fixed number of seconds instead. `bench.sh all` sweeps **every** scenario in `benchmarking/scenarios/` back-to-back: it builds the images once up front, runs each for `RUN_DURATION` seconds (default `60`), writes one JSON per rep to `benchmarking/output/`, and tears the stack down (`docker compose down -v`) between reps so each starts cold.

**Repetitions.** Each scenario is run `REPS` times (default `1`, but `3` in `bench.sh all`), tearing the stack down between reps so run-to-run noise can be told apart from a real runtime difference. Each rep's JSON is tagged `..._repN_...json`. Set `REPS` on a single scenario too (with `RUN_DURATION`) to repeat it unattended.

**Post-run report.** After a full `bench.sh all` sweep, `benchmarking/report.py` aggregates every per-rep JSON into [`benchmarking/output/report.csv`](benchmarking/output/report.csv) (one row per scenario) and [`benchmarking/output/report.md`](benchmarking/output/report.md) (one Markdown table per OFAT group, each cell `mean ± stdev` across reps). Every table reports `msgs_s` (ingested) alongside `committed_s` (committed to the DB), and p50/p95/p99/p999 for each of the three latencies. `bench.sh all` first clears `benchmarking/output/*.json` so the report covers only that sweep; run a single scenario and invoke `report.py` yourself if you'd rather accumulate runs across sweeps. Run it standalone at any time against an existing `output/` directory:

```bash
benchmarking/.venv/bin/python benchmarking/report.py
```

To override the poll interval, set `METRICS_INTERVAL` in your scenario file or environment (defaults: `5`s in duration mode, `10`s interactive).

### Running a scenario

```bash
chmod +x bench.sh

# One scenario, interactively (Ctrl+C to stop):
./bench.sh benchmarking/scenarios/timescale_load_p20.env

# One scenario, fixed 60s unattended run:
RUN_DURATION=60 ./bench.sh benchmarking/scenarios/timescale_load_p20.env

# The full OFAT sweep (all 25 scenarios, 60s each, unattended):
./bench.sh all
```

### Available scenarios

All 25 scenarios follow a **one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT)** design: every file changes exactly one variable from a shared **anchor** (`20` publishers ≈ 20k msg/s, pool `20`, batching on at size `50` / timeout `200`ms, no payload padding), so any measured effect is attributable to that one factor.

The anchor batches because the single-row write path cannot sustain 20k msg/s: rows queue ahead of the database and end-to-end latency climbs for as long as the run lasts, which makes the measured percentiles a function of `RUN_DURATION` rather than of the runtime under test. The `Batching` group keeps one `BATCH_ENABLED=false` run as the reference point showing that.

Since there is now a single anchor, six files are identical to it (`load_p20`, `pool_20`, `payload_0`, `batchsize_050`, `batchto_0200`, `batching_on`). That redundancy is deliberate: at `REPS=3` a sweep measures the anchor 18 times, and the spread across those runs is the noise floor that differences elsewhere in the report should be judged against.

| Group | File pattern | Factor swept | Values (**bold** = anchor) |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Load | `timescale_load_p{NN}.env` | `PUBLISHER_COUNT` | 4, 8, 16, **20**, 32, 48 |
| Pool | `timescale_pool_{NN}.env` | `DB_POOL_SIZE` | 5, 10, **20**, 50 |
| Payload | `timescale_payload_{N}.env` | `PAYLOAD_PADDING_BYTES` | **0**, 256, 1KB, 10KB |
| Batch size | `timescale_batchsize_{NNN}.env` | `BATCH_SIZE` | 20, **50**, 100, 200, 500 |
| Batch timeout | `timescale_batchto_{NNNN}.env` | `BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 50, **200**, 500, 1000 |
| Batching | `timescale_batching_{off,on}.env` | `BATCH_ENABLED` | off, **on** |

The two batch factors are not independent: a buffer flushes on whichever trigger fires first, so the
**effective batch size** is roughly `min(BATCH_SIZE, per-writer rate × BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS)`. Rows are routed
round-robin across `DB_POOL_SIZE` writers, so at the anchor each writer sees ≈ 19k/20 ≈ 950 rows/s and a
50-row buffer fills in ≈ 53ms — well under the 200ms timeout, which makes `BATCH_SIZE` the binding trigger
under load and leaves the timeout as the latency guard for low-rate periods. Sweeping the timeout below the
fill time therefore does not measure the timeout so much as silently shrink the effective batch. Where the
timeout is the shorter of the two (e.g. `batchto_0050` against the anchor's ≈53ms fill) the timer wins every
cycle rather than racing the buffer, because it is armed on the first row of each new buffer instead of
free-running — so the flush period is fixed and the resulting tail is *tighter* than a size-triggered one,
not noisier.

**Why the load sweep stops at 48 publishers.** Load generation is co-located with the system under
test on the same host, and the publishers are the largest CPU consumer in the stack. Up to 32 publishers
both runtimes deliver ≥97% of the nominal 1000 msg/s per publisher; at 48 Erlang still delivers 98% while
Scala drops to 77%, because a Scala publisher costs roughly 34% more CPU per message. A 64-publisher
scenario used to exist and was removed: at that scale the observability stack fails before any valid
measurement is taken — the Erlang subscriber's `/metrics` endpoint takes 9–16s to answer (against
Prometheus's 2s budget, so its target reports `down` for the whole run) and Scala's cAdvisor target times
out scraping 71 containers. The pipeline itself stays healthy there — the Erlang stack was measured
committing 28k rows/s while Prometheus reported it down — so the failure is one of measurement, not of the
runtimes. Treat 32 publishers as the ceiling for cross-runtime comparison and 48 as an
Erlang-only headroom point.

The no-batch-vs-batch comparison is the `Batching` group: `timescale_batching_off.env` versus
`timescale_batching_on.env` (the latter identical to the anchor).

### TODO / Planned

- **Warm-up analysis** — runs currently measure from `t=0` including startup. Retain the per-interval time series and analyse the startup transient (latency-vs-time, time-to-steady-state — the JVM ramp vs. BEAM's flat start) separately from the steady-state plateau, rather than folding both into one aggregate. **Prerequisite:** the latency metrics must first move from Prometheus quantile **summaries** to **histograms**. A summary exposes a pre-computed quantile over a fixed sliding window, so it can't be re-sliced after the fact; a histogram keeps the raw bucket counts, letting `histogram_quantile()` recompute a quantile over just the post-warm-up window. Until that migration lands, a steady-state cutoff can't be applied to the latency percentiles.

## 🧠 Deep Dive: Pekko Executors

### Fork-Join vs. Virtual Threads

The project explores different execution models for Pekko Actors:

#### Fork-Join Executor (Default)
In the default implementation, actors are dispatched on a `fork-join-executor`. Actors are treated as tasks pushed onto a deque and executed on a fixed pool of platform threads.
- **Pros**: Highly efficient for non-blocking workloads.
- **Cons**: If an actor performs a blocking I/O operation, it stalls the underlying platform thread, potentially leading to thread starvation.

#### Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
Pekko 1.2.0+ and Java 21/24 introduce support for `virtual-thread-executor`. Virtual threads are lightweight, runtime-managed threads (similar to Goroutines in Go).
- **Behavior**: When a virtual thread blocks, it is unpinned from its carrier platform thread, allowing other virtual threads to continue execution.
- **Advantage**: Allows writing simple, blocking code while maintaining the scalability of asynchronous systems.

The current implementation uses the **Fork-Join Executor**. To experiment with Virtual Threads, the `application.conf` can be adjusted to use the `pekko.dispatch.VirtualThreadExecutorConfigurator`.
